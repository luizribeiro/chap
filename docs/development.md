# Development

This guide describes the repository layout and local development workflow.

## Workspace

- `crates/chap-core` owns configuration, plugin loading, and the embeddable agent
  runtime.
- `crates/chap-cli` builds the `chap` executable and owns command-line and
  terminal interaction.
- `crates/chap-plugin` is the thin plugin-author facade over Lockgate and owns
  the shared `chap:agent` WIT package.
- `plugins` contains independently compiled WebAssembly components.

The CLI is the default workspace member, so root-level `cargo run` commands keep
working while other frontends can depend directly on `chap-core`.

Running CHAP without a subcommand opens its terminal interface using the
configured `openai` provider:

```console
cargo run
```

## Running locally

Run the project with the system Cargo:

```console
cargo run -- --help
```

With direnv installed, `direnv allow` enters the same environment automatically.
Entering the development shell also installs the configured Git hooks. Formatting
and Clippy run before commits, while the test suite runs before pushes. Run the
commit hooks manually with:

```console
pre-commit run --all-files
```
